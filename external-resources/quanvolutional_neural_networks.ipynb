    "In summary, a convolutional neural network includes preprocessing layers prior to optimisation layers so that features in the input (which are often images) are extracted and amplified. The result is a model with greater predictive power. This processing also improves classification of images as it extracts features even if they are translocated between images. This means that searching for a particular pixel distribution (for example the shape of a curve or line may be a useful feature when classifying digits) is not dependant on the distribution being in an identical location in each image where it is present. The convolutional process extracts this information even if it is slightly rotated or translocated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of the convolutional layer involves a grid for each feature being passed over the entire image. At each location, a score is calculated representing how well the feature and the section of the image match, and this becomes the value of the corresponding pixel in the output image. As a guide, a large score represents a close match, generally meaning that the feature is present at that location of the image, and a low score represents the absence of a match."

    "Our general approach is similar to that used in a conventional convolutional neural network however the initial processing occurs by running the images through a quantum circuit instead of a convolutional filter. Each simulation of a circuit represents one 3x3 filter being applied to one 3x3 region of one image. The construction of the circuit is randomised (see below), however this construction only occurs once per filter such that each region of the image being transformed by the same filter gets run through the same circuit. A single, scalar output is generated from the circuit which is used as the pixel strength of the output image, and the remainder of the neural net uses only classical processing, specifically two further convolutional layers, max pooling and two fully connected layers. This architecture has been chosen to closely mimic the structure used in our reference paper (Henderson et al, 2020), however as they note, \"The QNN topology chosen in this work is not fixed by nature ... the QNN framework was designed to give users complete control over the number and order of quanvolutional layers in the architecture. The topology explored in this work was chosen because it was the simplest QNN architecture to use as a baseline for comparison against other purely classical networks. Future work would focus on exploring the impact of more complex architectural variations.\""

    "Henderson et al summarise the use of quantum circuits as convolutional layers: \"Quanvolutional layers are made up of a group of N quantum filters which operate much like their classical convolutional layer counterparts, producing feature maps by locally transforming input data. The key difference is that quanvolutional filters extract features from input data by transforming spatially local subsections of data using quantum circuits.\" Our approach to the circuit design is based on the paper and is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The input images are iterated over and each 3x3 region is embedded into the quantum circuit using the threshold function: \n",
    "$$|\\psi \\rangle = \\begin{cases} \n",
    "                      |0\\rangle & if & strength\\leq 0 \\\\\n",
    "                      |1\\rangle & if & strength > 0\n",
    "                   \\end{cases}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "As the pixel strengths are normalised to values between -0.5 and 0.5, it is expected that brighter regions of the image will intialise their corresponding qubit in the state $|1\\rangle$ and darker regions will intitialise the state $|0\\rangle$. Each pixel is represented by one qubit, such that 9 qubits are used in total, and this quantum circuit is reused for each 3x3 square in the filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) We next apply a random circuit to the qubits. To implement this, a random choice from Rx, Ry and Rz gates is applied to a random qubit, and the total number of gates applied in each layer is equal to the number of qubits. With a set probability (which we set to 0.3), a CNOT gate will be applied instead of the rotation to two random qubits. We have chosen to set the parameters of rotation with random numbers between (0,2Ï€) however futher optimisation of the model could be found from using a variational circuit and optimising these parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Further layers could be applied of the random gates. To simplify, we only apply one layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) A scalar is outputted from the circuit and used as the corresponding pixel in the output image. We generate this number using the following method. The state vector of the final state of the circuit is simulated and the state corresponding to the most likely output (largest modulus) is selected. We then calculate the number of qubits for this state which are measured as a $|1\\rangle$. \n",
    "\n",
    "5) A total of four filters are applied to each image, and for each filter steps 1-3 are repeated with a different randomised circuit. The output image therefore contains a third dimension with four channels representing the four different outputted values which each filters produced."

Furthermore, we chose to assign a two qubit gate to any random qubits with a certain probability (labelled ratio_imprim, set to 0.3) rather than setting a connection probabiltiy between each pair of qubits (this approach follows the Pennylane tutorial). The seed is used for reproducability and its value is set depending on which filter the circuit represents (see QuantumModel below).\n",
