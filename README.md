<h1> PyTorch On the Rocks </h2>


<h4> An interface for bulding variational quantum-classical neural networks with PyTorch and Tequila </h4>


Note: In classical_pytorch_layer, using _TorchFunction.forward in the layer's forward function gives a different error output than just trying to call _TorchFunction.
